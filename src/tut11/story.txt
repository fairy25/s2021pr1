Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses
He does not seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed
The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services
He gasps My friend is dead What can I do


The operator says Calm down I can help First let us make sure he is dead
There is a silence then a gun shot is heard


Back on the phone the guy says OK now what
